                            <p>Nelson Mandela once said, <b>“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. The power of education extends beyond the development of skills we need for economic success. It can contribute to nation-building and reconciliation.”</b><br>This saying applies to all times, whether it is a time of national crisis or of nation development.<br>Education is the key to many locked doors. And as said above, education is not only skill development, or completing various courses and degrees, but is a life-long learning. Education teaches you to be more patient, empathetic, open-minded, and civilized for a better future. It not only gives you knowledge, but also teaches you the importance of little things. After all, we all learn the value of human relationships and respect in the very beginning at school.<br><div id="ART"></div>Education does not discriminate between the rich and the poor. One who is educated, will rise through the crowd no matter how modest or affluent his upbringing is. The motive of our NGO is to provide free of cost education to the children who are not able to afford it. Along with the academic skill development and learning, we simultaneously focus on the multidimensional growth of a child. We guide them to be proficient in:<br>a) Defence skills<br>b) Communication skills<br>c) Business skills<br>d) Art and music skills<br>We believe that if a child has access to all these fields of learning, it will help him make wiser career choices.</p>

                            <h1><center>Project Art Awareness & Development</center></h1>
                            <p><b>“What is art? Why do you think it is important?”</b><br> When asked this question, most of the people would give fancy replies stating art is the essence of life, its the beauty in creation, etc., etc. However, there are many such people who would not let their children take up art stream for a future or for a living.<br>Although, we talk about this as a bygone issue since it was the past times when parents wouldn’t let their children dance, sing, compose or paint for a living, yet it is one of the most controversial topics in a middle class family. Sports, music, painting or any other form of art are still not wholly considered as a life-long earning skills. Parents dream of their children to become doctors, engineers or CA’s, for which they often take loans(which they cant afford), but would want to curb the natural interest of the child, sidetracking it as a pass-time or hobby.<br><div id="SPIRITUALITY"></div>This has led us to enlighten and encourage people to be more accustomed to the open-mindedness of this century. We firmly believe that the natural interest of a child should be protected.<br>Unfortunately, such kids who forcefully study engineering for the sake of their parents’ wish, are seen to fail more frequently at their jobs, and that leads to depression and the onset of hopelessness.<br>We, at our NGO, are a group of people who constantly make efforts to bring out the natural talent and interests of a child and nurture it with the help of learned artists in their own field, may that be music, painting, drawing, craft making etc. ART EDUCATION is equally important to professional education. A child should not feel deprived of his right to choose, and must be given guidance to choose rightly.<br>We make our best endeavors to bring joy to the children by helping them grow in education as well as in art.</p>

                            <p>When we utter the word ‘spirituality’, what we are saying is,<b>“I want to become all-inclusive or all-exclusive. I want to include everything as a part of myself, or I want to just exclude everything, including myself.” These are two ways- either include everything or exclude everything. Either become infinite, or become zero; the in-between is an endless trap. ~Sadhguru</b><br>By spirituality, we not only mean that you must have an inclination towards god, but we mean that how close you are to yourself. Being spiritual brings in confidence, positive energy and along with that, abundance. These are the qualities required for a person to not only be successful, but also satisfied at heart.<br><div id="SOCIAL"></div>We believe that if we are able to instill even a drop of spirituality in our students or the people around us, it will enhance their lives in great ways, as it has ours. If one gets to know himself and his inner abilities, there is nothing in the world that he cannot achieve. Then spirituality becomes a fountain of positivity and motivation.<br>Negativity can't even touch you if you're in a state of meditation.<br>To instill these values in our students, we at our NGO, conduct debate sessions, story reading to younger students, and along with that, sessions on ​yoga and meditation. It helps them be physically, mentally and emotionally conscious about themselves and prepares them for a better future.<br> We do all this for free to make the world a better place. As it is said “​Charity begins at home ​ ”, we contribute our little effort for our nation. </p>

                            <p><b>“Not all of us can do great things, but we can do small things with great love”~ Mother Teresa.</b><br>We believe that the root cause of all our problems, may it be tiny or colossal, is nothing but the lack of social awareness in our country. Social awareness is nothing but social knowledge and responsibility. Most of us still believe that whatever wrong that is happening to us is the fault of our government. And the organizations working for a social cause are the ones responsible for the betterment of the society overall.<br>However, this mindset is holding us back from developing to our best selves. Our NGO works toward bringing social awareness by conducting ​planned debates, and seminars ​ with as many people as possible. We aim to develop a problem-solving approach within our students and completely eradicate the more prevalent complaining behavior.<br>In our seminars, we focus on the global issues like population, global warming, pollution control and environment protection. We empower the thought that we must treat the national problems as our own problems. ​Because we as individuals make a nation, as many drops of water make an ocean. Harmony is the key to development.<br>Our constant and untired efforts are towards a more socially aware and harmonious society, and we hope with constant support, we all can make a change together.</p>
